# Kanban Board

Welcome to my Kanban Board project. This project is designed to help users manage their work and improve their workflow.
Features

- The board is divided into columns, each representing a different stage of the work process.
- Tasks are represented by cards, and the card's position on the board represents its current stage of completion.
- Limit of tasks for each column is applied.
- Local Storage is used for data persistency.
- Function components, hooks, and context API are used for building the project.
- ESLint is used for code linting.
